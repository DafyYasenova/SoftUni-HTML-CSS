                        <p>Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do
                            that,
                            but
                            great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.</p>

                        <p> Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct
                            individual
                            accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people
                            to
                            attain
                            uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a
                            company
                            work, a society work, a civilisation work.</p>
